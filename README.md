# SENTINEL AI

**Human-Centered Decision Intelligence Architecture**  
Supporting responsible AI in high-risk decision-making environments.

---

## 🚀 Overview

SENTINEL AI is a **human-in-the-loop AI decision intelligence service** designed to **augment human decision-making** rather than replace it.  
The system provides **explainable risk assessments, anomaly detection, and structured recommendations** while maintaining **full accountability, auditability, and compliance**.

> AI should advise. Humans decide. Trust is the core metric.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In sensitive domains like finance, compliance, and security:

- Automation often **removes human accountability**
- Traditional systems generate **high false positives**
- Decisions are **opaque and hard to audit**
- Ethical and regulatory risks are often ignored

**SENTINEL AI solves this** by providing **context-aware, transparent, and human-controlled intelligence**.

---

## 🧱 Core Principles

1. **Human Authority First** – Humans always retain final control  
2. **Explainability by Design** – Every recommendation is traceable and interpretable  
3. **Security & Compliance First** – Data and decision integrity are top priorities  
4. **Modular Intelligence** – Rules, ML, and LLM components are replaceable  
5. **Auditability** – Immutable logs of every recommendation and human override  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview


**Key Features:**

- **Rules Engine:** Deterministic, configurable, and compliant  
- **ML Anomaly Detection:** Pattern recognition for risk scoring  
- **LLM Reasoning Layer:** Provides explanations and context, never decision-making  
- **Explainability & Transparency:** SHAP-like insights and human-readable summaries  
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Mandatory human review and override  
- **Immutable Audit Logs:** Traceable decisions for compliance and governance

## 🛡️ Threat Model

**Main Risks:**

1. **Model Misuse** – mitigated with human oversight  
2. **Data Leakage** – mitigated with encryption, access controls, and minimization  
3. **Bias Amplification** – mitigated with preprocessing, monitoring, and human validation  
4. **Accountability Loss** – mitigated with signed decisions and audit logs

## ⚖️ Trade-Offs

| Decision | Benefit | Cost |
|----------|--------|------|
| Human-in-the-loop | Accountability, trust | Slower decisions |
| Explainability | Transparency | Slight performance hit |
| Rule + ML hybrid | Reliability | Higher design complexity |
| Audit-first | Compliance-ready | Extra storage & compute |
